# Top-down 2D Shooter in Godot

This is a very basic 2D Top-Down Shooter game made in Godot. After following some basic tutorials, I put this mini-project together (note: some of this code is from following tutorials, which I will link the ones I used below). It's still a work-in-progress, and there's still a plethora of problems with it (i.e. no game over screen, no score screen, etc.), but I hope to fix these problems soon.
